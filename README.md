**üöÄ AI-Powered Internship Recommendation Engine (SIH)**

This repository contains the core AI engine and a standalone Flask API for the SIH Internship Recommendation project. The engine provides personalized internship recommendations, skill gap analysis, and other analytics.

**‚ú® Key Features**

1.AI-Powered Recommendations: A lightweight TF-IDF model that matches students to internships.

2.Skill Gap Analysis: An intelligent feature to show students the skills they are missing for a specific role.

3.Admin Analytics: Endpoints to find top candidates for an internship and analyze the national skill gap.

4.AI Based resume Keywords generation

**üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack**

1.AI & Machine Learning: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

2.Backend API: Flask

3.Database (for prototype): SQLite (via CSV files)

4.Generative AI: Google Gemini (for planned features)

**‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**
